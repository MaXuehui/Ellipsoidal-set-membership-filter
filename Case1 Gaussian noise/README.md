Please run the file CompareKFandSMF_Gaussian.m

We use the file GaussianNoiseConfidenceDim3.m to generate 3-dim noises, and use the file GaussianNoiseConfidenceDim2.m to generate 2-dim noises.

The confidence is calculated in ConfidenceCalDim3.m and ConfidenceCalDim2.m, which is used to calculate the paramater (e.g. Sigma = 0.00072*[5 0 -1; 0 5 0; -1 0 5];) in noise generation with different confiednce.
