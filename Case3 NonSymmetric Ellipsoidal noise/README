Please run the file CompareKFandSMF_NonSymUniform.m

We use the file NoiseNonSymUniform.m to generate noises that had a non-symmetric uniformly distibution with 90% in (1,0) and 10% in (-1,0).

NoiseNonSymUniformData3dim.mat and NoiseNonSymUniformData2dim.mat are non-symmetric uniformly distibuted noises.
